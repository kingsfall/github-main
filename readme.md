Below is a paragraph summary for all the projects that I have worked on as well as current projects I am working on.

## List of projects
#### 1. Sudoku solver - Dec 2019

Sudoku solver was developed on python. It was a project I took up to familarize myself on manipulating lists and dictionary. 
Instead of programming a solver using backtrack algorithm, I decided to program a human approach to solving the puzzle.

#### 2. Parking Chatbot - Feb 2020

The purpose of the parking chatbot is to provide the user with an interactive user interface for finding possible carparks in the vicinity in Singapore.
For instance, I have feedback from people that they would not mind walking a bit more for a cheaper HDB/URA carpark instead of parking in a shopping mall.
The parking chatbot will output 3 possible parking spots with information such as distance to destination as well as the cost of parking for them to make better informed decisions. 

#### 3. Carousell Scraper - Mar 2020

I developed a Carousell scrapping script as I was deciding on purchasing a used laptop. Sellers would only put down their laptop specifcations such as number of  RAM in the description.
I had to click on every listing to identify if the listing was a laptop that meet my specifications. The scipt I developed will output all the lisitng in an excel file with specifications, price and
direct links to the listing. I plan on further developing a Web App for users to input their search terms and output an excel file for easy viewing.  

#### 4. Programming Skills in demand 2020 - April 2020

This project came about when I was deciding on which path of develop my programming knowledge. I would like to know what skills and roles are currently in demand for remote work
by the market in 2020. I scrape WeWorkRemotely to get the keywords for job openings. After which I did a simply text cleaning by removing caps, spaces and dashes.
Based on research, I created a simple classification dictionary with types of programming roles as keys and populated the values with skills such as python, react, ruby, etc.
I felt there is no need to be using any complicated text classification NLP packages as there was not a lot of data to train on. Thereafter, I visualized the data with barchat from scikit learn.
